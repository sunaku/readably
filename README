Readably is a minimal static blog engine that emits clean, readable Web pages.
You can view them locally on your own computer without needing a Web server,
and later publish them to any Web server---they will function just as they did
locally on your own computer.  This is the benefit of a *static* blog engine!

Following KISS philosophy, Readably is a grand simplification of Rassmalog[1].
It has simple navigation that works well in text-mode Web browsers (such as
Lynx, elinks, and w3m) and in modern HTML5-compliant Web browsers also.  And
its blog entries are beautifully printable in the latter kind of Web browsers.

(coming soon) It has an internal categorization system that will train a
Bayesian classifier to help your visitors directly find related blog entries
instead of manually wading through pages and pages of categories themselves.

See my personal blog[2] for an example of what is possible with Readably.

Installing:

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/readably.git

  # branch
  cd readably

  # seed
  mkdir content/
  cp -vb EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/
  cp -vb EXAMPLE.config.yaml config.yaml

Configuring:

  * Edit the config.yaml and template/* files to your liking.

  * Edit the rakefile to configure the blog processing logic.
    (This isn't really necessary, but you are free to do so.)

Blogging:

  Create a new blog entry (*.readably file) from the template:

    cp EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/your-entry-file-name.readably
    $EDITOR content/your-entry-file-name.readably

  Create a new blog entry (*.readably file) in a nested directory:

    cp EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/your/path/your-entry-file-name.readably
    $EDITOR content/your/path/your-entry-file-name.readably

Running:

  If you are using Ruby 1.8.7, add "-rubygems" to the following commands.

  # render the blog (default task)
  rake
  rake default      # same as above
  rake render       # same as above

  # remove rendered files
  rake clean

  # see available tasks
  rake --tasks

Previewing:

  $BROWSER content/index.html

Publishing:

  # upload the content/ directory (omit *.readably files)
  # to your chosen $DESTINATION; trailing slash is needed!
  #
  rsync -auv content/ --exclude '*.readably' $DESTINATION/

Upgrading:

  # assuming that "origin" points to github.com/sunaku/readably
  git fetch origin
  git checkout master
  git rebase origin/master
  git checkout personal
  git rebase master
