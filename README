Readably is a minimal static blog engine that emits clean, readable Web pages.
You can view them locally, on your own computer, without needing a Web server,
and later publish them to any Web server---they will function just as they did
locally, on your own computer.  That is the meaning of a *static* blog engine!

Following KISS philosophy, Readably is a grand simplification of Rassmalog[1].
It has simple navigation that works well in both text-mode Web browsers (such
as Lynx, elinks, and w3m) and modern HTML5-compliant Web browsers alike.  And
its blog entries are beautifully printable in the latter kind of Web browsers.

It has an internal categorization system that will (coming soon) train a
Bayesian classifier to help your visitors directly find related blog entries
instead of manually wading through pages and pages of categories themselves.

See my personal blog[2] for an example of what is possible with Readably.
