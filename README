Readably is a minimal static blog engine that emits clean, readable Web pages.
You can view them locally on your own computer without needing a Web server.
And when you publish them to *any* Web server, they will function just as they
did locally on your computer.  This is the benefit of a *static* blog engine!

See my blog http://snk.tuxfamily.org/log/ for an example of Readably output.


Features:

  * Its output is easy to read and beautiful to print in modern Web browsers.

  * Its output is self-explanatory and multi-lingual: no translation needed.
    (There is only 1 English phrase in the entire output, for attribution.)

  * It has simple navigation that works well in both text-mode Web browsers
    (such as Lynx, elinks, and w3m) and modern Web browsers (like Firefox).

  * It supports Javascript-based comment services: Disqus and IntenseDebate.

  * (COMING SOON) It has an internal categorization system that will train a
    Bayesian classifier to help your visitors directly find related blog
    entries instead of manually wading through pages of categories themselves.


Prerequisites:

  * Ruby 1.8.7 or newer   -  http://www.ruby-lang.org
  * Rake 0.8.7 or newer   -  gem install rake
  * Slim 1.0.3 or newer   -  gem install slim


Installing:

  # install
  git clone git://github.com/sunaku/readably.git

  # branch
  cd readably
  git checkout -b personal

  # initialize
  mkdir content/
  cp -vb EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/
  cp -vb EXAMPLE.config.yaml config.yaml


Configuring:

  * Edit the config.yaml and template/* files to your liking.

  * Edit the Rakefile to configure the blog processing logic.
    (This isn't really necessary, but you are free to do so.)


Blogging:

  Create a new blog entry (*.readably file) from the template:

    cp EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/your-entry-file-name.readably
    $EDITOR content/your-entry-file-name.readably

  Create a new blog entry (*.readably file) in a nested directory:

    cp EXAMPLE.entry.readably content/your/path/your-entry-file-name.readably
    $EDITOR content/your/path/your-entry-file-name.readably


Running:

  If you are using Ruby 1.8.7, add "-rubygems" to the following commands.

  # render the blog (default task)
  rake
  rake default      # same as above
  rake render       # same as above

  # remove rendered files
  rake clean

  # see available tasks
  rake --tasks


Previewing:

  $BROWSER content/index.html


Publishing:

  # upload the content/ directory (omit *.readably files)
  # to your chosen $DESTINATION; trailing slash is needed!
  #
  rsync -auv content/ --exclude '*.readably' $DESTINATION/


Upgrading:

  # assuming that "origin" points to github.com/sunaku/readably
  git fetch origin
  git checkout master
  git rebase origin/master
  git checkout personal
  git rebase master
